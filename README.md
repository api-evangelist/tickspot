The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [TickSpot APIs](http://www.tickspot.com/).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://www.tickspot.com/)- [Developer](http://www.tickspot.com/)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tickspot)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/tickspot/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the TickSpot APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
